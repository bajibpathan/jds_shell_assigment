ted is a stream editor. A stream editor is uted to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline). While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), ted works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient. But it is tedâ€™s ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.
